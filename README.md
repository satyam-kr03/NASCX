This project aims to develop a network-aware semantic communication framework to efficiently support XR traffic in 6G.

Unlike traditional communication, which focuses on delivering all data bits accurately, semantic communication transmits only the most meaningful and perceptually important information, reducing overhead while maintaining user experience.

By estimating the semantic relevance of XR frame regions and applying adaptive compression based on real-time network conditions, the system can prioritize critical content, minimize delay, and improve scalability.

A reinforcement learning-based scheduler will be developed to dynamically allocate resources, ensuring immersive and reliable XR experiences even under network congestion.

The framework will be validated using Simu5G simulations.
